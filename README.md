# BF4Internal Cheat for Battlefield 4

## Project Overview

BF4Internal is an old project internal cheat for Battlefield 4, developed to learn Frostbite internals. This project includes features such as an aimbot, visual enhancements, and other utilities. This code is very old (2022) so don't judge, it was one of my first serious hacks.

## Features

- **Aimbot**: FOV, Smooth
- **ESP** : Skeleton, Boxes, healthbar
- **Misc** : Some player class variable changes
- **Damage Modifier** : That one is fun

### Prerequisites

To build and use this cheat, you need:

- A working C++ development environment (Visual Studio recommended).
- DirectX SDK and Windows SDK.
- New Offsets
